# Excel Learning Journey
Welcome to my repository! This space documents my progress as I learn Microsoft Excel. Here, you'll find a collection of file that i have been working on, and projects that I've completed during my Excel course.
My goal is to solidify my understanding of various Excel functions, formulas, and data analysis techniques. Feel free to browse through the files and follow along with my learning adventure!

The course covers topics such as basic data entry, formula creation, data visualization, pivot tables, and more.
The repository is organized to reflect the acheivements of mine.

You are welcome to download and explore the Excel files in this repository. If you are also learning Excel, these files can serve as practice examples or templates. Feel free to modify and experiment with the data and formulas to reinforce your understanding.
My goal is to continue adding practice files and projects as I advance in my Excel skills.
